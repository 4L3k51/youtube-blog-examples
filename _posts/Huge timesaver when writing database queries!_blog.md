If you need to do advanced AI tasks with Supabase, go with the Supabase MCPP server. For quick or simple stuff, just use the Supabase AI assistant in the dashboard.

Open the AI assistant right in your project dashboard. It can use as much or as little context from your project as you want. When you need example data for testing features, or you want help writing complex SQL queries (like joining data from multiple tables), the assistant can handle it directly in the dashboard, right next to your data.

If you want to tweak further, you can pull the AI-generated query straight into the SQL editor. This saves a ton of time and keeps everything in one place.
