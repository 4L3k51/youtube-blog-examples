# Quickly Generate Example Data or SQL in Supabase with AI

For quick AI help in Supabase, open the Supabase AI assistant right inside the dashboard. You can give it as much or as little context about your project as you want.

Whenever you need realistic example data for a new feature, or want to avoid writing a tricky SQL query that joins multiple tables, ask the assistant. It can generate the data or write the SQL for you, directly next to your tables. If you want to tweak the SQL further, move it into the SQL editor and keep going.

For more advanced AI tasks, use the Supabase MCVP server.
