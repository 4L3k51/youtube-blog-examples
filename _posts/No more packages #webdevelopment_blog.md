### Supabase Quick Workflow with Bun

Bun comes with fast, built-in support for SQLite and S3. That means you can upload files or query a database with just a few lines—faster than using regular NPM packages.

1. **Set Up Supabase**  
   Go to [database.new](https://database.new) to instantly spin up a free Supabase project. You get a Postgres database, S3-compatible storage, and more.

2. **Add Environment Variables**  
   Plug the Supabase credentials into your project’s environment variables.

3. **Build with Less Code**  
   With everything ready, you can write tiny scripts to upload to S3 storage or query the Postgres DB straight from your Bun app.  
   - Less code to write and maintain  
   - Faster execution  
   - Fewer tokens if you're passing code to tools like Claude later

No boilerplate, just quick and efficient cloud workflows.
