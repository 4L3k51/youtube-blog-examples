Bun comes with SQLite and S3 support built into the runtime—no extra NPM packages needed. That means you can upload files to S3 or query a SQLite database with just a couple of lines.

To get a bigger backend in seconds, head to [database.new](https://database.new) and spin up a free Supabase project. You’ll get a hosted Postgres database, S3 storage, and more, out of the box.

Just set your environment variables, and you’ve got an app that can upload files to S3 and run Postgres queries—fast, with less code to write and maintain. When you use tools like Claude code, less code also means fewer output tokens.
